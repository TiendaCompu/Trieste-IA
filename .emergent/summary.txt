The AI engineer has been working on enhancing a workshop management application, focusing on AI-driven features, UI/UX improvements, and addressing critical functional gaps. The initial phase involved implementing AI-assisted vehicle registration (voice/OCR), comprehensive data models (vehicles, clients, mechanics, orders, services), and fixing environment issues.

The trajectory shows an iterative process. Initially, the AI engineer addressed a request to implement dictation functionality for order fields, updating backend models and frontend components. Following this, the user provided a comprehensive list of functional requirements, which the AI engineer systematically tackled: making order details read-only with a dedicated edit mode, implementing a robust global dictation system, and standardizing UI elements with consistent branding.

The engineer also guided the user through local environment setup, troubleshooting MongoDB connection issues, and handling PC restarts. Most recently, the focus has been on vehicle registration enhancements (client document validation, removing duplicate dictation buttons) and resolving a bug in the mechanics' edit functionality. The current task involves fixing the Escanear camera button in vehicle registration, requiring a complete camera system with device selection.

<product_requirements>
The application is a multi-platform (PC, Android, iOS) workshop management system with AI capabilities for vehicle registration (photo OCR, voice input for details like license plate, make, model, year, color, mileage, client data). It manages corporate fleets, spare parts/services for invoicing, and mechanic assignment. Key workflows include client arrival, AI-assisted registration, diagnosis, mechanic assignment, repair, and delivery (requiring budget approval). The web-based platform needs custom branding (yellow background, white cards, blue borders, specific logo) and improved UI. Recent additions included mileage history, order filtering, and a Venezuelan invoicing system (Bs., USD, 16% IVA, 3% IGTF, fiscal data, vehicle photos).

Current detailed requirements:
1.  **Vehicle Registration**: Matrícula must be entered/scanned/dictated first, blocking other fields. Document of identity (Cedula/RIF) is prioritized for client data validation, blocking other client fields until validated. Remove duplicate dictation/scan buttons from matrícula input; fix Escanear camera.
2.  **Work Orders**: Order details should be read-only. An Editar button must be *inside* the order detail card, leading to an edit mode where only diagnosis, detected faults, repairs, spare parts, status, and assigned mechanic can be changed (dictation option included).
3.  **Mechanics**: Mechanics should load correctly. Editar button should match Borrar button size. Allow 2-3 specialties. All specialty badges (ovals) must be blue with white text.
4.  **Services & Repuestos**: Service/Repuesto list items should have improved contrast for their type indicators (badges). All badges/ovals globally should be blue with white text.
5.  **Vehicles**: Implement vehicle history as a medical record. Ver otros vehículos should show other vehicles linked to the same owner (identified by unique ID).
6.  **Owner Information**: Display name/company, phones with call/WhatsApp buttons, and email link.
7.  **Configuration**: Settings (gear icon) should allow centralized customization of system colors, logo, and other details.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported bug in the **Registro de Vehículos** section. Specifically, the Escanear button, intended to capture vehicle document images via camera, was not functioning correctly (it was a simple file input, not a camera interface). The user explicitly requested the ability to choose between different cameras (e.g., webcam, IP camera).

The AI engineer had started investigating this by locating the existing Escanear Documento button and identified that a complete camera capture system with device selection capabilities needed to be implemented. During the initial implementation attempt, a conflict with a duplicate  function declaration was encountered. The last action was to remove this duplicate function in  to clear the path for the new camera integration.
