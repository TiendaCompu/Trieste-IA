The AI engineer iteratively developed a workshop management application, tackling features like AI-assisted vehicle registration (voice/OCR), comprehensive data models (vehicles, clients, mechanics, orders, services), and custom UI/UX. Key challenges included integrating emergent LLM for AI features, establishing robust data handling (UUIDs, date formats), managing frontend state and routing, and resolving persistent environment/connectivity issues, particularly with database consistency and API URLs. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, addressing frontend syntax errors, backend API functionality, and complex data flow logic. Recent work focused on enhancing mechanic management, implementing a mileage history system, improving order filtering, and integrating an advanced Venezuelan invoicing system with multi-currency and tax logic. The AI also significantly improved AI-driven dictation and image capture for vehicle registration.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a powerful, multi-platform workshop management application (PC, Android, iOS) featuring AI capabilities for streamlined vehicle registration via photo (OCR) or voice input, automatically extracting details like license plate, make, model, year, color, mileage, and client data. The application must manage corporate fleet vehicles with strict control over client information, applied spare parts/services for invoicing, and mechanic assignment based on specialization. A detailed vehicle history (medical record style) is crucial, alongside budgeting, invoicing, and payment tracking. The core workflow involves: client arrival, AI-assisted vehicle registration, diagnosis, mechanic assignment, repair, and delivery (requiring budget approval). The platform must be web-based, accessible via mobile and PC, and adhere to custom branding (yellow background, white cards, blue borders, specific logo) and improved UI elements. Recent additions include: updating mileage for existing vehicles with history tracking, filtering orders by status (active/history), generalized search (client/vehicle), and a Venezuelan invoicing system supporting two currencies (Bs., USD), 16% IVA, 3% IGTF (for USD payments), various payment methods, detailed client/vehicle fiscal data, and vehicle photos.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Órdenes (Orders) section, specifically addressing a user report that the Editar button on order details was not functional and that fields for fallas, diagnósticos, etc., were missing. The engineer confirmed the  component was lacking a proper edit route and necessary input fields. The last action taken was updating the  model in  to include new fields crucial for the detailed invoicing system: , , and . This is part of a larger initiative to build out the full Venezuelan invoicing system with multi-currency, tax, and payment method support.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue updating the  model and related logic in the backend, and then implement the frontend  component.
