<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a comprehensive workshop management application. The process was iterative, starting from core features and progressively adding complexity based on user feedback. Key challenges involved integrating AI for vehicle registration (voice/OCR), establishing robust data models (vehicles, clients, mechanics, orders, services), handling frontend state and routing, ensuring data integrity (unique license plates, date formats), and implementing custom UI/UX designs. The AI demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in resolving persistent frontend syntax errors and ensuring backend API functionality before proceeding to UI integration. The trajectory highlights the AI's ability to interpret nuanced user requests and systematically implement them while addressing technical debt like data duplication and error handling.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a powerful workshop management application (PC, Android, iOS) with AI capabilities to streamline vehicle registration. The AI should quickly fill vehicle details (license plate, make, model, year, color, mileage, client data) from photos (OCR) or voice input. The core function is managing corporate fleet vehicles, requiring strict control over client information, applied spare parts/services for invoicing, and mechanic assignment based on specialization. A detailed vehicle history (medical record style) is crucial, along with budgeting, invoicing, and payment tracking. The workflow is: Client arrival → Vehicle Registration (AI-assisted) → Diagnosis → Mechanic Assignment → Repair → Delivery (with budget approval before repair). The platform should be web-based, accessible via mobile and PC interfaces. The AI must implement custom branding (yellow background, white cards, blue borders, specific logo) and improved UI elements (button styles, icon sizes).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Mecánicos (Mechanics) section. The user requested:
1.  **Format consistency**: Dates as DD/MM/AAAA, Phones as 0000-000.00.00.
2.  **WhatsApp field**: Add an option to indicate if a mechanic uses WhatsApp.
3.  **Mechanic Status**: Replace the simple Activo (Active) toggle with detailed statuses like Disponible (Available), Fuera de Servicio (Out of Service), Vacaciones (Vacation), with manual and future automatic modification.
4.  **Photo upload fix**: The previous photo upload for avatars wasn't working.

The AI engineer started by updating the mechanic model in the backend to include , , and new  fields. Then, formatting functions for dates and phone numbers were added to the frontend. The  component was being updated to integrate the new statuses and WhatsApp field in the editing form when the trajectory ended.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue updating the frontend form for mechanic management to include WhatsApp and the new status fields.
